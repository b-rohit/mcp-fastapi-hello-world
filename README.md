# MCP Hello World

This repository contains code to create MCP server with FastAPI with popular libraries. I found the MCP world quite confusing to start with. Many libraries and sdks with similar names, each includes mcp and fast in the name somehow. It is an attempt bring a bit clarity in MCP wild west.

## Examples

### Server

- [MCP Python SDK](./mcp-python-sdk/README.md)
- [FastMCP](./fastmcp/README.md)
- [FastAPI-MCP](./fastapi-mcp/README.md)

### Client

- [fast-agent](./fast-agent/README.md)
- [mcp-agent](./mcp-agent/README.md)
